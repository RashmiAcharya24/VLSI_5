# VLSI_5

This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) in Verilog. The ALU performs various arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shift operations, and more based on a 4-bit mode input. It takes two 4-bit operands and an optional carry flag as inputs and produces an 8-bit result along with a 4-bit flag output (Zero, Sign, Overflow, Carry).
